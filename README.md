- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JAPNEET30
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating a multithreaded file transfer system for Windows
- And a Net banking Simulation System.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, python, c# in general-purpose languages
- For web development, I'm working on HTML, CSS, PHP, .net framework, javascript,
- (learning typescript is an interest but I haven't entered the system yet).

I am interested in understanding newer technologies.
